# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project:
Dana is working on a website which provides in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Users can search the recorded sightings with filtered by city, state, country, and shape of the object seen. Dana is able to create the website by using HTML, and enbaling JS object to hold and filter the sighting information.

## Results:

The website landing page provides user a brief about the website and its contents. Below is the image of header of the landing page.

The filtering of results provides the user tabulated results of the UFO sightings. The sighting data is being pulled from JS object file, which included mutliple recorded sightings.

## Summary:

While our website looks goods and provides relevent information to the user, the results can further be improved by:

  1. Adding additional filter such lenght of sightings, and adding number of people who observed it.
  2. Getting more information, the current data deals with primarily sightings in the US, if global data is added, it will enable more robust verification of the sighting.
